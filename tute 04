Tutorial 4
1)
•	Missing parentheses around the condition
•	Incorrect operator “=” used for equality “==” comparison.
•	Inconsistent indentation.

2) The variable number is assigned the value 4, and alpha is assigned the value -1.0.
The outer if statement checks if number is greater than 0. Since number is 4 (greater than 0), the inner if statement is entered.
The inner if statement checks if alpha is greater than 0. However, alpha is -1.0 (not greater than 0), so the else block is executed.
The statement printf("No, I'm here! \n"); is executed and prints "No, I'm here!" to the console.
After that, the program continues executing the next statement printf("No, actually, I'm here! \n"); outside of any conditional block. This statement is executed regardless of the conditions in the if statements, and it prints "No, actually, I'm here!" to the console.
The output produced by this program segment would be:
No, actually, I'm here!

3) The logic of the if statement can be explained as follows:
If doesSignificantWork is true:
If makesBreakthrough is true, the variable nobelPrizeCandidate is set to true.
If makesBreakthrough is false, the variable nobelPrizeCandidate is set to false.
If doesSignificantWork is false, i.e., !doesSignificantWork is true:
The variable nobelPrizeCandidate is set to false.
Therefore, the possible values of nobelPrizeCandidate based on the conditions are:
nobelPrizeCandidate is true when doesSignificantWork is true and makesBreakthrough is true.
nobelPrizeCandidate is false when either:
doesSignificantWork is true and makesBreakthrough is false, or
doesSignificantWork is false.

double cost;
if (distance >= 0 && distance <= 100) {
    cost = 5.00;
} else if (distance > 100 && distance <= 500) {
    cost = 8.00;
} else if (distance > 500 && distance < 1000) {
    cost = 10.00;
} else if (distance >= 1000) {
    cost = 12.00;
}
